## Hi there

---

## I’m currently working on ...
- DietMonitorApp

 *An Android app that monitors the progress of your diet. Just enter your weight each day and track your weight loss!*

- FIXTools
 
  *A C# code generator that takes FIX.xml specifications as input and generates a C++ constexpr FIX header library (that can be used to 'decode' FIX messages).*
        
- StatisticsLibrary

  *A C++ library of statistical functions (mean, var, sd, ...), tests (t-test, z-test, F-test ...) and analyses (time series, pca, lda).*

- NaturalLanguageProcessing 

  *A long-standing C# project that tests ideas in natural language parsing. Currently waiting to implement micro-grammars and chains.*

## I’m currently learning ...
- WinRT (C++) for authoring COM-like components that can be consumed by UWP and WinUI applications (I have a couple of projects demonstrating these stacks: MediaCollectionWinUI and StatisticsViewer).
- GitHub using docs.github.com
- CMake
